Step 2 – Hydrogen Consumption Data sources
•        Fleet Data Required:
•        Growth rate
•        Aircraft type and frequency of operations
•        GSE types, quantities and operating patterns
•        Aircraft data (aircraft_data.csv)
•        GSE data (gse_data.csv)
Step 3 – Hydrogen Demand Calculation – Aircraft
Step 3 – Hydrogen Demand Calculation – GSE
•        Hydrogen Demand Output
•        Aircraft H2 volume
•        GSE H2 volume
•        Total H2 demand
•        GSE chosen information
•        Charts

 Step 4: Storage Capacity & Land Calculation
•        total_storage_volume = aircraft_H2_volume + GSE_H2_Volume
•        usable_volume_of_LH2 = water_volume * (1-ullage)*(1-evaporation_rate)
•        #_of_tanks = H2_demand_volume_per_day/usable_volume_of_LH2
•        tank_footprint = width * length
•        H2_stockage_area = tank_footprint * #_of_tanks
•        Storage Capacity & Land Calculation Output
•        # of tanks
•        Storage area required
•        Charts

•        Step 5: Regulatory Compliance – Distance
•        Checking Compliance
•        Convert storage volume (ft^3) à gallons
•        Compare capacity to regulations
•        Verify Safety distance and tank requirements
 Step 5: Regulatory Compliance - Requirement
•        Output – Regulatory Compliance

Step 6: Sustainability Analysis
•        Emission Reductions:
•        Calculate CO₂ emissions reductions from replacing Jet A, Diesel, and Gasoline with Hydrogen
•        total_emissions = jetA_emissions + diesel_emissions + gasoline_emissions
•        Emission Factors:
•        Jet A: 9.57 kg CO₂/lb
•        Diesel: 22.38 kg CO₂/lb
•        Gasoline: 19.64 kg CO₂/lb
•        Environmental Benefits:
•        Improved air quality
•        Lower operational carbon footprint
•        Output - Sustainability Analysis
•        Charts
•        Time series
